       		So who am I ? That is a very complicated question but we should start with the simple part : My name is Tareq Bengah, I’m 17 years old and right now I’m a first year student in network and telecommunications at the IUT of Colmar. I currently live in Village-Neuf, which is a small village, located in France at the border of Switzerland. As you may have realised, I really love movies and especially visual effects. I do have other hobbies, such as martial arts, music, cars and weirdly magic…but I wanted to dedicate this page to VFX. Before we go any further let’s do some explanation and start from the very beginning. I was born the 2nd of March 2004 on an amazing island called Mauritius. I lived there for the first ten years of my life and truth be told, this is where I began to dream about being part of this Industry. In 2014, my family and I moved to europe. (My dad is Mauritian and my mom is German, so I have both nationalities). As I was saying, we came to France in december 2014, and settled in January 2015. 
A few years ago, as I started high school, I downloaded a great software called blender and I’ve been creating stuff ever since. On this page you will find and learn about some projects that I have worked on through the past two years. So let’s get started on the technical point.
The image that you can find next to this text is a project I did in September after watching the movie Shang-chi and the ten rings. I started by taking a picture of myself pretending to be looking at some amazing rings. Afterwards I modeled and textured a ring in 3d using Blender.
I duplicated it and when I had several rings, I placed them correctly and rendered an image of the initial picture with the rings overlayed on top. To finish I added the lightning strikes in “Hitfilm”, but you can use any software you want (ex:photoshop). I did some color grading and voilà !!

       		I went through multiple steps to create the image above and I’m going to explain them to you.
First of all I made a rough sketch of how I wanted my image to look like at the end. Then I gathered the necessary assets and images that I needed for the creation of a frame like this one. And by assets of course I mean ; 3d models (ex : the rocks, the warrior),  plug-ins for the software that I use (to add the grass) and images for the background. I had modeled some assets previously so I used those to create the render. Once I had all the assets, I started to place the 3d objects correctly in the 3d environment of my 3d modelling software. I added some textures, some clouds and if you’re wondering how I made the water, I simply added a 3d plane and applied some metallic noise texture to it. I played with the lighting a bit, then added an HDRI image. Finally I auto-generated some grass and did some image composition. By the way, I would like to specify that most of the techniques I’m using here are very similar to the ones big VFX companies such as ILM or Weta digital are using.

       		Now this 3d render that you are watching took me about 12 hours of work to make. It was one of the most ambitious projects I had until now. The process was divided into many different steps. But to explain it in a few lines, I did what is called  3D sculpting. It is basically like normal sculpting except that it is done in a computer software. Just like modelling, I made sure to have a lot of references at my disposal throughout the entirety of the project. For the curious ones, I used a Wacom intuos S (graphics tablet) for the sculpture. After some very hard hours of sculpting, I textured my dinosaur and started to create a 3d environment for my final scene. I added some grass, plants, rocks, water and some images for the background. Finally I did some image composition and I came up with this result=)

This might feel like there is a lot of information missing and that's completely true. I do not want to be too technical on this website because I would like to keep things simple but if you’re interested in knowing more, you might want to visit this page : https://e-portfolio.uha.fr/user/tareq-bengah/modele-de-page-par-defaut

       	Here are a few more pictures of projects that I had. These are mainly 3d renders with some image composition. I used similar techniques as the ones I mentioned above, but it's mostly 3d sculpting, modelling, texturing, environnement creation, lighting and rendering. Inspiration for those projects came as always from movies, tv shows, the internet, books and games. If you want to take a closer look, I suggest right clicking on the images and selecting "open in a new tab".
